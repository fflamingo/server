**FFlamingo Server** is:

* A backend solution focused on getting things done.
* A set of abstractions built to make trivial tasks trivial, and keeping away boilerplate from complex activities.
* An _opinionated_ project: there is no "best" path, but there is always a "good and maintained" way.
* _GraphQL_ centered: we got a shiny new tool that does exactly what we wanted. Let's implement it.
* Integrated with [fflamingo-client](https://github.com/fflamingo/client) for a Full-Stack solution.

# Why?

Developing JavaScript apps is becoming utterly complicated and the [JavaScript](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4)
[Fatigue](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) doesn't
seem to go away anywhere soon. We felt the pain to bootstrap, update, configure and mess up
with so many tools and packages. Furthermore, trying to manage a full-stack JS system
is really impratical.

Given that, after many large scale apps being built, we thought about a solution that may
share common patterns and powerful tools between them, while keeping low the
mainteneance overhead.
